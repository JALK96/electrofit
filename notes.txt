gromacs topology location: 

/home/johannal96/miniconda3/envs/AmberTools23/share/gromacs/top

you might want to look into the the antechamber -j option if things fail dramatically, regarding bond assignment. 

pmx mutant for proteins and with dedicated mutation libraries. not so good for ligands. for ligands look for AZtutorial in pmx developer branch or pmx (python 2 based) ligands directory tutorial. 
CHARMM-GUI good for system setup but does not yet support GROMACS. So pmx is the better choice.
